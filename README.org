* How to use

- Steps:
  1. Run SC3 code in =toplap-v3.scd= file
  2. Run python OSC server
  3. Run bokeh application

- Each time you run delete all data txt files: =rm data*.txt=

PS: - Steps 1,2 was the basis of my live coding performance for TOPLAP's 15th birthday anniversary!!!
    - Thanks [[https://github.com/georgezachos][George Zachos]] for his input on the bokeh script.


** Run python OSC server

Run: =python osc-server-sc3-stream.py=

** Plot using bokeh

Run: =bokeh serve --show plot-bokeh-stream.py=

Note: Start bokeh application after we get some data into SC3, so that =data-array.txt= file has some amount of data to plot.
